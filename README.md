DSA Problem Tracker

Project Overview  
The DSA Problem Tracker is a Python-based application designed to help track and analyze solved Data Structures and Algorithms problems. The tool enables consistent problem-solving by organizing problems based on topic and difficulty level.

Technologies Used  
Python  
File Handling  
CSV Data Storage  

Features  
- Add solved DSA problems with topic and difficulty  
- View all recorded problems  
- Store progress using CSV files  
- Simple menu-driven interface  

Working Description  
The application stores problem details in a CSV file. Each entry consists of the problem name, topic, and difficulty level. Users can add new records or view existing records through a text-based menu interface. The system helps maintain a structured record of DSA practice.

Learning Outcomes  
- Strengthened Python fundamentals  
- Hands-on experience with file handling  
- Better organization of DSA learning  
- Improved consistency in problem-solving practice  

Future Enhancements  
- Filter problems by topic or difficulty  
- Generate statistics and progress reports  
- Visualization of problem-solving trends  
- Integration with online coding platforms
